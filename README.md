## Stroke-Detection-Model-
#This is a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has had a stroke based on several health-related features.

# Dataset:
The dataset used to train and evaluate this model was obtained from the Stroke Prediction Dataset on Kaggle. The dataset contains 5,110 patient records with 11 features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and more.

# Model Selection
After exploring the dataset and preprocessing the data, we decided to use an ANN and a XGBoost Classifier as our model. We chose XGBoost because it is a highly effective model for handling imbalanced datasets like the one we were working with. We also used undersampling to balance the dataset and improve the model's performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning
We used a RandomizedSearchCV approach to tune the hyperparameters of the model. We selected the following hyperparameters to tune:

n_estimators
max_depth
learning_rate
subsample
colsample_bytree
scale_pos_weight
After 100 iterations of RandomizedSearchCV, we selected the hyperparameters that resulted in the best cross-validation F1-score.

Model Evaluation
We evaluated the model on a validation set and a test set. The model achieved the following metrics on the validation set:

Accuracy: 0.73
Precision: 0.66
Recall: 0.96
F1-score: 0.78
ROC AUC: 0.72
The model achieved the following metrics on the test set:

Accuracy: 0.73
Precision: 0.66
Recall: 0.96
F1-score: 0.78
ROC AUC: 0.72

The model works very well for not giving false negative predictions, which is the most important criteria that needs to be fulfilled in this scenario. 
Usage
To use the model, you will need to install the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file. Once installed, you can load the model using the following code:

python
Copy code
import pickle

# Load the model from file
with open('xgb_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    xgb_model = pickle.load(f)
    
# Use the model to make predictions
features = [[67, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 228.69, 36.6, 0.516, 3]]
predictions = xgb_model.predict(features)
Note that you will need to pass in an array of features in the same format as the original dataset.

Conclusion
This stroke detection model achieved good performance on both the validation and test sets, with an F1-score of 0.82 on the validation set and 0.80 on the test set. With further tuning and improvements, this model could be used to help detect strokes early and improve patient outcomes.
